1. Title
Analyzing Houston Air Quality: Time Series Trends in Aerosol Optical Properties and VOCs
2. Research Question(s)
•	How do AAE and SAE vary over July in Houston, and what do they indicate about aerosol sources?
•	What is the relationship between formaldehyde and VOC concentrations, and how does this link to secondary organic aerosol formation?
•	Are there significant pollution events during this period, and what are their potential causes?
3. Objective(s)
•	Develop a time series analysis workflow to explore air quality trends in Houston using aerosol optical properties (AAE, SAE) and gas-phase pollutants (VOCs, formaldehyde).
•	Identify key pollution events and possible source contributions.
•	Provide a reproducible R script for researchers to analyze similar datasets.
4. Approach
This analysis will use Python (or R) for time series data processing, visualization, and correlation analysis.
•	Data Handling: Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values.
•	Exploratory Analysis: Generate summary statistics, visualize trends over time.
•	Correlation Analysis: Investigate relationships between AAE, SAE, VOCs, and formaldehyde.
•	Event Detection: Identify peak pollution episodes and compare with meteorological conditions (if available).
•	Code Documentation: Provide step-by-step comments and explanations in the script.
The final tutorial will be hosted on GitHub with detailed documentation and examples.
